Hey, I’m Gabby! I grew up around many creative and highly extroverted relatives. Many of them are expressive through singing while I was more expressive through my drawings and crafts. What I find super fascinating is how a voice can be portrayed through visual arts and design. I am a soft-spoken girl but I can make the right voice stand out in any design.

Branding, print and motion graphics are my specialties. I’m an innovative thinker and problem solver who loves learning new things. In my work, I’m all about simplicity and effectiveness. Feel free to check out my other work or contact me!

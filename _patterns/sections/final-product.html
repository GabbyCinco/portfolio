    <p>This is the final revision of the preferred identity for Kneaded Touch. It consists of a simple logo as well as the company name and subhead. The two curved tops of the graphic represent the shape of two thumbs as well as the motion of how a masseuse would massage someoneâ€™s back. The bright orange/red colour with the grey executes a feeling of strength and relief. The simplistic graphic is now legible in smaller scales.</p>

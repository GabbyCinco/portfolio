    <p>Hey I'm Gabby! Some recognize me by my exotic last name which means Five Lions (Cinco=5 + leon=lion). Ironically, I am a part of a family of 5… plus a dog. My top artistic influencers growing up are my uncles. All seven of my mother's brothers are incredibly creative people with a passion for music and visual arts. Only one of them persued a career in the arts which encouraged me to continue drawing and improving my skills. One thing that I find super fascinating about graphic design, is how a voice can be portrayed through a design piece. I am a soft-spoken girl but I make sure that the right voice stands out in any design.</p>
    <p>Branding, print and motion graphics are my specialties. I’m an innovative thinker and problem solver who loves learning new things. In my work, I’m all about effectiveness with simplicity. Feel free to check out my other work or contact me!</p>

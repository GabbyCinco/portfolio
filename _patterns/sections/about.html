    <p>My name is Gabriella Cincoleon, Gabby for short. Some recognize me by my last name which means Five Lions (Cinco=5 and leon=lion). One thing that I find super fascinating, is how a voice can be portrayed through visual arts and design. I am a soft-spoken girl but I can make the right voice stand out in any design.</p>
    <p>Branding, print and motion graphics are my specialties. I’m an innovative thinker and problem solver who loves learning new things. In my work, I’m all about effectiveness with simplicity. Feel free to check out my other work or contact me!</p>

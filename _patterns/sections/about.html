    <p>Hey I'm Gabby! Some recognize me by my last name meaning <span class="italic">Five Lions</span> (Cinco=5 + leon=lion). Interestingly, I am a part of a family of 5… plus a dog. My top artistic influencers growing up are my uncles. All seven of my mother's brothers are incredibly creative people with a passion and talent for music and visual arts. One out of seven persues a career in the arts which was encouraging for me to continue drawing and improving my skills. It was exciting, knowing that it was possible to draw and create impactful things for a living. What really fascinating about graphic design, is how a voice can be portrayed through a design piece. I am a soft-spoken girl but I make sure that the right voice stands out in any design.</p>
    <p>Branding, print and motion graphics are my specialties. I’m an innovative thinker and problem solver who enjoys learning new things. In my work, I’m all about simplicity with effectiveness. Feel free to check out my other work or contact me!</p>

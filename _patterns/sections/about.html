    <p>Hey, I'm Gabby! Some might recognize me by my last name which means <span class="italic">Five Lions</span> (Cinco=5 + leon=lion). My main artistic influencers are my closest uncles. All were talented, self-taught musicians. As a growing, self-taught artist myself, their passion was always inspiring to me. When I learned what graphic design was, it further ignited my passion to create artistic yet impactful things for a living. One fascinating thing about graphic design, is that there is always a specific voice portrayed in the form of beautiful design. I am a soft-spoken woman but with design, I make sure that the right voice reaches the client's target audience.</p>
    <p>Branding, print and motion graphics are my specialties. Iâ€™m a problem solver who enjoys learning new artistic skills and facts about my clients. Feel free to check out my other artwork or contact me!</p>

    <h2 class="coral push-0">Challenge</h3>
    <p>The task for this project was to design a minimalist poster for one of the special days that are celebrated by the United Nations. The one that was chosen for this project is International Jazz Day. The challenge was to have the illustrations minimal yet expressive of the topic.</p>
    <h2 class="coral push-0">Research</h3>
    <p>Jazz performances in the 1920s were not only beautiful to listen to, they were visually appealing to watch with the vibrant purple and yellow/white lighting on the stage. The main shining instruments associated with this genre such as the saxophone, piano, base and drums reflect the beautiful lighting and emphasize the look and feel of the laid back music.</p>

    <p>The final poster included colours such as purple, yellow, brown and black. The colours itself represent the entire mood of the topic. Along with the colour palette, are simple illustrations of two musicians: one playing the saxophone and the other playing the piano. To make things more interesting, the long ovals represent the spotlights shining down on the stage. The clothing of the musicians represents the fashion of the 1920s. The content and typography was only required to incorporate the title and the date of the celebration. To finish it off, the United Nations logo is placed at the bottom of the composition. Overall, although the illustrations were not very detailed, the minimalist appearance is enough to convey the message to all viewers.</p>

    <p>In addition to the poster design, I had transformed it into a promotional motion graphics video. The goal was to attract a wider audience with this special United Nations celebration. This piece includes  up-beat jazz music, simple shape animations that move to the beat and a logo reveal. The same colour scheme was and illustration style was applied in this composition. I was inspired by animation films such as <span class="italic">Monsters Inc.</span> and <span class="italic">Ratatouille</span>. Both movies have a scene showing expression with animated shapes and colours. This is an innovative project that brings print design into motion design. This 30 second video could be posted on social media or broadcasted on TV. With both the video and print piece, this promotion would definitely reach out to a wider audience. </p>

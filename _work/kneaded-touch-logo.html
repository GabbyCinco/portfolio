    <h2 class="coral push-0">Challenge</h2>
    <p>The challenge was to redesign a logo for a local company. I chose a massage therapy clinic known as Kneaded Touch. The overall appearance and construction of their current logo was far too generic for its competitive market. It includes 2 different serif fonts, 3 colours with gradients and a graphic of a sprout. One important note, is that it becomes illegible in reduced sizes. Next, is colour choice. Kneaded Touch uses green which is used by most of its competitors. The gradients applied to the rest of the colour palette, cause more difficulty in legibility for reduced sizes.</p>
    <h2 class="coral push-0">Research</h2>
    <p>Kneaded Touch is an Ottawa, Canada based business with three locations: Merivale, Barrhaven and Westboro. Their goal is to fix and relieve their clientâ€™s chronic pain with massage therapy.</p>

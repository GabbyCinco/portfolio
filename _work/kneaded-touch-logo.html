    <h2 class="coral push-0">Challenge</h3>
    <p>The challenge was to redesign a logo for a local company. I chose a massage therapy clinic known as Kneaded Touch. The main problem with their current logo is that its overall appearance and construction was far too generic for its competitive market. The current logo design includes 2 different serif fonts, 3 colours with gradients and a graphic of a sprout. The first design issue is legibility in reduced sizes. Second, is the choice of colours. The main green colour of the brand is used in almost every competing logo and the gradient, applied to the palette causes more difficulty in legibility on smaller scales.</p>
    <h2 class="coral push-0">Research</h3>
    <p>A logo redesign project done for a massage therapy brand called Kneaded Touch. It is an Ottawa, Canada based business with three locations: Merivale, Barrhaven and Westboro. This massage therapy clinic strives to fix and relief their clientâ€™s chronic pain.</p>

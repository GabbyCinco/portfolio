    <p>The project started with deciding which marvel character would replace certain types of cards. So this was planned by having the Marvel villains as the face of the club and spade cards and the Marvel heroes as the face of the heart and diamond cards. The images were from the internet and the original owners were credited and printed on the packaging of the product. Each image was photoshopped onto the card’s suit. To make things more interesting, a 3D effect was shown by making the character look like it’s popping outside of the suit/shape. There are so many characters in the Marvel universe, so in case the person holding the card does not know recognize a certain character, its name will be on the top and bottom-right corners of each card. Moving on, the back designs shows a large image of the Marvel logo. Overall, the final product turned out beautifully. I will definitely include my own illustrations or photography for when I plan to print and sell playing cards to a client. I am glad to have discovered that this design process can be used for any playing card concept. It is dynamic and easy to use.</p>

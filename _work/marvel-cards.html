  <h2 class="unit xs-1 coral push-0">Final Product</h2>
  <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 push">
    <p>The project began with deciding which Marvel characters to use for all 52 cards. It was decided that the clubs and spades represented the villains while the hearts and diamonds represented the heros.</p>
    <p>Each image was photoshopped onto the cardâ€™s shape. To make things more interesting, a 3D effect was applied providing the illusion of the character escaping the inside of the shape. There are hundreds of Marvel characters, so in case the user does not recognize a certain character, its name is displayed so that it can always be read on the top. Moving on, the Marvel logo is the main focus of the back design. Overall, the final product turned out beautifully.</p>

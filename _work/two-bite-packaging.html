    <h2 class="coral push-0">Challenge</h3>
    <p>The challenge was to create a package redesign for an existing brand that uses excessive plastic material for their product. The ultimate goal is to design a more eco-friendly package by replacing all or reducing the amount of plastic.</p>
    <h2 class="coral push-0">Research</h3>
    <p>Two-Bite is a company known for its unique, bite sized baked goodies sold in grocery stores. They are mostly famous for their delicious brownies and cupcakes. Their red velvet flavoured cupcakes is the main focus of this project. Their aim is to bring groups of people together with their delicious mini cupcakes. The problem with their original packaging is that it is made entirely of plastic. We can find alternate materials that will be more environmentally friendly.</p>

    <p>This was interesting to work with because of the challenge of containing 12 objects.</p>
    <p>The main plastic material was replaced with thick cardstock paper for the final design. Unfortunately the box could not be entirely free of plastic. There must be a section of the box where the consumers can view these beautiful desserts because it is important for them to see the state of them since they are quite delicate. No one wants to be disappointed to see them smushed when they open the box. The box is entirely made of cardstock paper while the top section is thin recyclable plastic. In addition, the simple prism structure makes it easy to stack on shelves and tables.</p>
    <p>The colour palette consisting of red, burgundy, beige, black and white were kept because they complement the specific flavour of the product. The rigid edges and alternating shades of red along the sides of the box cover, represent the texture of the cupcake paper cup. This provides a unique feature differentiating it from ordinary cupcake boxes. The rest of the package is left white to maintain a bright theme. Its interior structure holds all twelve cupcakes is in a fun staircase display. This display leaves enough finger space for people to grab one without touching the others, which is something that buyers will definitely appreciate. Gifting is the overall concept of this design. Gifts are a symbol of celebration and happiness. So for the second element, a small tag was added along with a hemp cord (paper string) to finish the package design.</p>

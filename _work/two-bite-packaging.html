    <p>The main plastic material was changed to thick cardstock paper for the final design. Unfortunately the box could not be entirely free of plastic. There must be a section of the box where the audience can view these beautiful desserts because it is important for customers to see the physical state of it. Cupcakes are quite delicate and no one wants to be disappointed to see them smushed when they open the box. This repackage is entirely made of cardstock paper while the top section is thin recyclable plastic. In addition, the simple prism structure makes it easy to stack these boxes.   Starting with the colour swatches: red, burgundy, beige, black and white were reused because they complement the specific flavour of the product. Next, the rigid edges and alternating shades of red along the sides of the box cover, represent the texture of the cupcake paper cup. This provides a unique feature, it’s rigid edges differentiate it from ordinary cupcake boxes. The rest of the package is left white to maintain the bright theme. On top of the box, the logo sits at the bottom of the transparent area to guide the eye from cupcakes to the brand name. The exciting part, is the interior structure that holds all twelve cupcakes is in a fun staircase display. This display leaves enough finger space for people to grab one without touching the others, which is something that buyers will definitely appreciate. Gifting is the concept of this design. Gifts are a symbol of celebration and happiness. So for the second element, a small tag was added along with a natural hemp cord (completely recyclable string) to finish the package design.

    <h2 class="coral push-0">Challenge</h2>
    <p class="milli">Client needed new illustrated cover designs for an adult novel series that consists of 3 volumes so far. The design is used for both paperback and eBook copies.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="unit gutter-1-2 xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1-2">
    <h2 class="coral push-0">Background</h2>
    <p class="milli">The Bliss romance series was written by Michelle Jo Quinn. The first volume was published in 2016 and there are currently three in total: 1. <i>Planning Bliss</i>, 2. <i>Proposing Bliss</i>, 3. <i>Chasing Bliss</i>. Weddings and Blissful events are the running concept around these stories, as the main characters in each volume are event planners.</p>
    <p class="milli">The author sought for minimalistic, illustrated designs for the series rebrand that included her new logo. These stories are targeted towards female adults interested in romance stories. The previous novel covers were created using photography and photoshop. One issue that stood out was the use of dark and light drop shadows behind the text in order for it to be legible in front of the image. On the back of the paperback version, the author’s logo and the description text is also placed in front of an image, making it difficult to read. Though the covers had a consistent design, it was too generic within its category. It was exciting for the author to go in the illustration direction for the first time.</p>

    <p class="milli">The client was very pleased with the redesigned covers. The main problem that was solved was the text legibility. Each piece of text contrasts well with the chosen colours and harmonizes with the artwork. <i>Elmaira, Regular</i> is the title font, <i>Dolly Pro, Bold</i>, is the secondary font and the body text is <i>InspireTWDC, Roman</i>. The title has an elegant script appearance while the secondary font supports the romantic feel with its eye-catching, vintage serifs. <i>InspireTWDC</i> was used for the description blurb because the sans-serif design is simple and legible in smaller point sizes.</p>
    <p class="milli">Moving onto the artwork, we wanted to express more of their personality on each cover since each story is focused on different characters. Certain elements carried out a cohesive design, yet each cover portrayed their own personality. The first element, is a yellow object. <i>Planning Bliss</i> (1) has a yellow heart stamp, <i>Proposing Bliss</i> (2) has a yellow ring and <i>Chasing Bliss</i> (3) has a yellow wine bottle. Second, is the brush strokes that bleed off of the composition. 1: strokes represent ribbons, 2: grape vines, 3: motorcycle tracks. Third, is the thin line art that frames the eye’s attention to the title. Fourth, is the flying petals/leaves that symbolize a blissful celebration. Fifth and last, is a scenery silhouette that runs along the bottom. All of these traits appear on each design and are adjusted to fit their story.</p>
    <p class="milli">Aside from the main elements, colour plays a strong role in expressing the aura within its unique love story. Expression is also shown through body language and the fashion, illustrated on the characters.</p>
    <p class="milli">Overall, the client’s needs were met and problems were solved. This resulted in a beautiful series of designs. It was a pleasure to work with an amazing author.</p>
